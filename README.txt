# MenuED - Interactive Console Menu for Data Structures (C#)

## Overview
This C# console application allows users to interactively explore and operate on different data structures, including:

- Vectors
- Matrices
- Lists *(To be implemented)*
- Queues *(To be implemented)*
- Stacks *(To be implemented)*
- Search Algorithms *(To be implemented)*

Each structure has its own submenu, which presents a list of educational exercises designed to demonstrate key concepts.
